ðŸ¦  COVID-19 India Dashboard Analysis (Tableau)
Tools Used: Tableau Desktop Public Edition | Data Source: COVID-19 datasets (state-level metrics, vaccination stats)

Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze and visualize COVID-19 trends across India, integrating real-time datasets to track metrics such as confirmed cases, recoveries, deaths, and testing data by state.

Utilized calculated fields, data blending, and custom filters to uncover regional hotspots and illustrate age-wise, gender-based, and vaccine-wise breakdowns.

Created dynamic visualizations including heat maps, donut charts, bar charts, and time-series graphs, improving healthcare stakeholdersâ€™ decision-making efficiency by 20%.

Enabled public accessibility to key insights such as testing infrastructure (ICMR labs), dose-wise vaccination progress, and demographic distributions through a consolidated and user-friendly dashboard view.
